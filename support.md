# Incognito Blocker Support
If you are experiencing issues with Incognito Blocker, please file an issue here:
https://github.com/brismuth/incognito-blocker/issues/new?template=bug_report.md

If it asks you to create an account, please do (it's free). I don't allow support requests through the Chrome Web Store because it doesn't notify me when people post there, and when I respond to people it doesn't notify them. I want to be able to actually help people, and that's why I redirect support requests to Github.
